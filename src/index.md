# Class Website

This is the class website for the Grand River Chinese School interest class on Grade 7/8
Olympic Math, taught by [Fengyang Wang](https://wafy.me/). The teaching assistant for this
class is [Eric Xiao](https://mathlord2.github.io/).

## Lecture 1 (September 28, 2019)

We reviewed the integers (including negative numbers) and introduced variables. We then
covered fractions using this new vocabulary and reviewed various operations on them.

The [homework](assets/homework/rational-numbers.pdf) and
[answers](assets/solutions/rational-numbers.pdf) are available.

If you would like more practice with fraction arithmetic, check out [Khan
Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/arithmetic/fraction-arithmetic). Don’t worry if
the variables don’t make sense yet — we will continue to practice them in future lectures.
