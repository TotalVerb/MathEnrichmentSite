# Class Website

This is the class website for the Grand River Chinese School interest class on Grade 7/8
Olympic Math, taught by [Fengyang Wang](https://wafy.me/). The teaching assistant for this
class is [Eric Xiao](https://mathlord2.github.io/).

## Lecture 5 (November 2, 2019) and Lecture 6 (November 9, 2019)

On November 2, we discussed some basics of sets, including their definition, membership,
equality, and subset relationships.

On November 9, we continued the discussion by introducing Venn diagrams, set union, and set
intersection.

For both weeks, the [lesson notes](pub/sets.html), [homework](assets/homework/sets.pdf) and
[answers](assets/solutions/sets.pdf) are available.

## Lecture 4 (October 26, 2019)

We discssed square roots of integers that are not perfect squares, like $3$. We found that
they do not exist as rational numbers. We made a graph showing the relationship between
rational numbers and their squares, and noted that if we could draw a continuous curve, then
there should exist a square root of $3$. We define the “real numbers” to represent this
concept of a continuum.

The [homework](assets/homework/real-numbers.pdf) and
[answers](assets/solutions/real-numbers.pdf) are available.

## Lecture 3 (October 19, 2019)

This lecture was taught by Eric Xiao. We discussed some exponent rules and introduced
polynomial equations.

The [homework](assets/homework/exponents.pdf) and [answers](assets/solutions/exponents.pdf)
are available.

## Lecture 2 (October 5, 2019)

We discussed some of the problems from last week’s homework. We then gave many examples of
word problems with a single variable. We noticed the similarities between these problems,
and discussed a solution to linear equations with one variable in general.

The [homework](assets/homework/linear-systems.pdf) and
[answers](assets/solutions/linear-systems.pdf) are available.

## Lecture 1 (September 28, 2019)

We reviewed the integers (including negative numbers) and introduced variables. We then
covered fractions using this new vocabulary and reviewed various operations on them.

The [homework](assets/homework/rational-numbers.pdf) and
[answers](assets/solutions/rational-numbers.pdf) are available.

If you would like more practice with fraction arithmetic, check out [Khan
Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/arithmetic/fraction-arithmetic). Don’t worry if
the variables don’t make sense yet — we will continue to practice them in future lectures.
